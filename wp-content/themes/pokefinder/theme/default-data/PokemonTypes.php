      'description' => "More moves are Normal type than any other type; however, many of these moves are status moves that don't inflict any damage. Prior to Generation IV, all Normal-type moves that dealt damage were physical attacks; today, the majority of Normal attacks remain physical, with only a few special-attacking Normal moves introduced plus a handful of previous attacks being changed to special-attacking. Normal moves are widely distributed among the majority of species of Pokémon, with several capable of being learned by every species that can learn TMs and HMs, or Move Tutor moves. Some low-powered moves like Tackle and Scratch stand out for being the first damage-inflicting move that various species learn by level-up."

      'description' => "Pokémon of this type can fly, many of them live at high altitudes, even. Most of them are based on birds and insects. Their power is mostly related with aerial and wind-related moves. Most of them have wings, but there are also some of them that just float without wings, like Rayquaza and Gyarados."

      'description' => "It is notable for being one of the three Starter types, forming a perfectly triangular relationship with Grass and Water.
      Fire-type moves are based on attacks of fire itself, and most of them can leave the status Burn. Fire types are also immune to being Burned, regardless of the type of move used that would have inflicted a Burn."

      'term' => 'Psychic',
      'taxonomy' => 'types',
      'slug' => 'psychic',
      'description' => "Many Pokémon are of this type, and, being the type with most Legendary Pokémon, for many, the Psychic-type is the most powerful. Psychic-type Pokémon tend to be very intelligent. It's also interesting to note that, many Psychic-type Pokémon are based/related to real scientific or mythological discoveries such as DNA and Psychokinesis."

      'taxonomy' => 'types',
      'slug' => 'water',
      'description' => "There are more Pokémon of this type than any other type due to the large number of marine creatures to base species from. Most Pokémon of this type also have another type, representing the biodiversity of marine creatures. Water is notably the second type to have been paired with every other type - the Fire/Water Volcanion completed all possible pairings."

      'slug' => 'bug',
      'description' => "Bug-type Pokémon are characterized by their fast growing, as they don't take long to evolve. Bug-type Pokémon live mostly (not all of them) in forests, some of them are a little harder to find because they live atop the trees."

      'slug' => 'grass',
      'description' => "Many Grass types are based on plants and fungi, not necessarily grass (Pokémon such as Cacturne, which is a cactus, and Foongus, which is a mushroom). Many Grass-type Pokémon also belong to the Plant Egg Group. Several Grass types are paired with the Poison type (Pokémon such as Oddish, Venusaur and Bellsprout), reflecting the toxicity of several plants towards mainly humans. Most Grass-types are also simply animals with plant life attached to them (Pokémon such as Bulbasaur, Paras, Sceptile, Gogoat and Tropius). Some Grass-types are also based on mythical creatures (Pokémon such as Shiftry, which is based on a Tengu, and Tangela, which is based on Medusa)."

      'description' => "Rock-type Pokémon stand out for their great defense to physical attacks; however, this type is tied with the Grass type as having the most weaknesses, with five, and Pokémon of this type are not very fast. Also, some Rock-type moves don't have great accuracy."

      'term' => 'Electric',
      'taxonomy' => 'types',
      'slug' => 'electric',
      'description' => "The Electric type is a type of Pokémon that have electricity-oriented powers. They possess electro-kinetic abilities, being able to control, store, or even produce electricity.
      Electric-type Pokémon have varied habitats, from forests and prairies to cities and power plants. Electric-type Pokémon are usually fast, and many of their attacks may paralyze the target. Some Electric-type Pokémon also resemble artificial objects used by humans which relate to electricity (the Magnemite and Voltorb evolution lines and Rotom)."

      'taxonomy' => 'types',
      'slug' => 'ghost',
      'description' => "The Ghost type is notable for having few Pokémon (many of whom have low HP) and moves. In battles, the Ghost-type is useful because it's the only type that has two immunities: Normal and Fighting, both of which are common move types. From Generation VI onwards, Ghost-types are also immune to moves and abilities that prevent escaping, like Block and Shadow Tag."

      'term' => 'Ice',
      'taxonomy' => 'types',
      'slug' => 'ice',
      'description' => "Ice-type Pokémon stand out for being able to endure very low temperatures, as well as adapting to freezing weathers. They control ice at will. Their habitats go from the top of mountains, frozen caves and caverns or even the poles."

    [
      'term' => 'Dark',
      'taxonomy' => 'types',
      'slug' => 'dark',
      'description' => "The Dark type was added in Generation II to counteract the Psychic type's dominance in Generation I, by being completely immune to it and able to hit Psychic types super-effectively. It was also given to make the Fighting type and Bug type more dominant due to their downfall to Psychic types in Generation I. Since Generation VI, it is weak to Fairy types."

      'term' => 'Fighting',
      'taxonomy' => 'types',
      'slug' => 'fighting',
      'description' => "Pokémon of this type are specialists in melee attacks, such as punches and kicks. It could be said that they're the opposite to Psychic-type Pokémon because while Pokémon of that type depend primarily on special attacks, Pokémon of the Fighting type depend mostly on physical attacks. In particular, every Fighting-type attack introduced before Generation IV remained a physical attack, with special Fighting attacks only being introduced from Generation IV onwards."

    [
      'term' => 'Dragon',
      'taxonomy' => 'types',
      'slug' => 'dragon',
      'description' => "The Dragon-type is often considered an ancestral type as many Legendary Dragon-type Pokémon are revered as deities. Other Dragon-type Pokémon are frequently hard to catch and train. They also evolve late and are relatively rare. An interesting fact is that the stats of many Dragon-type Pokémon surpass the stats of other types of Pokémon."

      'term' => 'Poison',
      'taxonomy' => 'types',
      'slug' => 'poison',
      'description' => "These Pokémon have a natural toxic quality; some directly represent real-world species known for their venom, such as snakes, and some even represent pollution itself. They normally live in caves, marshes or similar places."

    [
      'term' => 'Steel',
      'taxonomy' => 'types',
      'slug' => 'steel',
      'description' => "It was introduced in Generation II along with the Dark type to balance the Psychic type and Normal type, as both types were great offensively, but the Steel type was made for Pokémon defensively. It was also made for its many resistances as pure Steel types had 10 resistances and Electric/Steel types had 11 resistances along with a Poison-type immunity for both matchups."

    [
      'term' => 'Ground',
      'taxonomy' => 'types',
      'slug' => 'ground',
      'description' => "Ground-type Pokémon have powers and abilities related to control of ground and earth. Ground-type Pokémon are afraid of water, like Rock-type Pokémon, unless they are Water type. Many Ground Pokémon are also partially Rock type."

    [
      'term' => 'Fairy',
      'taxonomy' => 'types',
      'slug' => 'fairy',
      'description' => "The Fairy type was introduced in Generation VI to balance the Dragon and Dark types. It is super-effective against both types and also resisted most types that were introduced in the past Generation (mostly Bug, Fighting, and Dark types). Another reason why the Fairy type was introduced was to give offensive advantages to the Steel and Poison types. Prior to Generation VI, the Dark/Ghost-type Sableye and Spiritomb had no weaknesses, so the Fairy type was added to give them a weakness."
